Hello there! This is Sonia. 

This blog is used to write down the story of my transition from law school to the faculty of computer science. To be honest, I don't know if this adventure will have a satisfying ending, but I guess impermanence is the nature of life. What matters is that we have worked hard for our dreams and that we have the courage to go on the adventure.  

Welcome to schuwald, welcome to my adventure.  

*For someone who can use Chinese, I also put a link of my Chinese blog for you: [森川湖]( http://schu.world "森川湖")*
